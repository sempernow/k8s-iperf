>Bandwidth (Throughput) test of your K8s Cluster (Pod) Network.

- Both same-node and cross-node cases are measured.
- Often referred to as east-west or inter-pod traffic,
  these throughput measurements are expected to vary
  by host network, CNI provider, their configurations,
  and adjacent network-traffic conditions.

## Usage

```bash
bash k8s-iperf.sh
```
